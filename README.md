<br>
Consider the following pairs of expressions.

<ul>

 <li>Extol, praise highly</li>

 <li>Destitute, very poor</li>

</ul>

In (1), the verb extol is contrasted to the verb praise in its intensity. In (2), the adjective destitute is contrasted to the adjective poor in its intensity. Notice that both relations are

indicated by the presence of the intensity-modifying adverbs highly and very.

We have two underlying questions: First, can you think of a systematic way to identify such pairs above from the available text corpora? Second, can you think of intensitymodifying adverbs other than, or including, highly and very?

A <u>Specify your own problem definition</u> that abstracts over the two questions above, so that your problem asks you to B <u>write a Python code</u> to access some text corpora and to output results that contrast two expressions, such as extol and praise, or destitute and

poor, together with the kind of intensity modification, such as highly, very, and so on.

The output must include at least 50 pairs of expressions of reasonable quality. We will discuss later how to assess the quality of the output with measures such as precision or

recall, but for the purpose of this homework, you should C <u>use your own argument in English to show why your output is of reasonable quality, and how you can improve its quality further</u> by an extra stage of curation (automatic or manual correction/filtering).

Please note that your output does not have to be perfect, but your argument matters.

All the requirements as underlined above must be composed by yourself and without help from anyone else, including the related resources on the Internet, if any. Any similarity of the results will be flagged for plagiarism and, if found sufficiently similar, penalized, up to, but not limited to, a failure to this homework.
